1. @SpringBootApplication:
It is used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application and serves as the entry point for running the application
And it combines three important annotations: @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan. 

@Configuration:
 It is a class-level annotation. The class annotated with @Configuration used by Spring Containers as a source of bean definitions.


@Autowired: 
It is used to autowire spring bean on setter methods, instance variable, and constructor. When we use @Autowired annotation, the spring container auto-wires the bean by matching data-type.

@ComponentScan
: It is used when we want to scan a package for beans. It is used with the annotation @Configuration. We can also specify the base packages to scan for Spring Components.

@Bean: It is a method-level annotation. It is an alternative of XML <bean> tag. It tells the method to produce a bean to be managed by Spring Container.

@Component: It is a class-level annotation. It is used to mark a Java class as a bean. A Java class annotated with @Component is found during the classpath. The Spring Framework pick it up and configure it in the application context as a Spring Bean.

@Controller
@Controller annotation is used to define web controllers that handle HTTP requests and return views. 
@Service: It is also used at class level. It tells the Spring that class contains the business logic.
@Repository: 
It is a class-level annotation. The repository is a DAOs (Data Access Object) that access the database directly. The repository does all the operations related to the database.

@RequestMapping:
 It is used to map the web requests. It has many optional elements like consumes, header, method, name, params, path, produces, and value. We use it with the class as well as the method.
@GetMapping:-
The @GetMapping annotation is used to map HTTP GET requests to specific handler methods in a controller. It is a specialized version of the @RequestMapping annotation, specifically designed for handling GET requests. @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)
@PostMapping: It maps the HTTP POST requests on the specific handler method. It is used to create a web service endpoint that creates It is used instead of using: @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.POST)

@PutMapping: It maps the HTTP PUT requests on the specific handler method. It is used to create a web service endpoint that creates or updates It is used instead of using: @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.PUT)
@DeleteMapping: It maps the HTTP DELETE requests on the specific handler method. It is used to create a web service endpoint that deletes a resource
